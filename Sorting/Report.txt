      The predicate evaluates if the two sequences have the same values and if the amount of each
      value are the same.

      Example:  (1,2,2,3) is the same as (2,1,3,2) because you have the same amount of all the
      individuale values. One 1, two 2:s, one 3.
      Example:  (1,1) is not the same as (1) because in the first one you have two 1:s and
      the later only has one 1.
