public void insert(int x)

Statement coverage is obtained by following test cases:

insert_addValueSmallerThanExsistingNumber_AddValue()
insert_addValueBiggerThanExsistingNumber_AddValue()

Branch coverage is obtained by following test case:

insert_addSameValueAfterArrayAlreadyContainsValues_AddValuesExceptDoubles

public void member(int x)

Statement coverage is obtained by following test cases:

member_EmptyArray_ReturnFalse()
member_ContainsValue_ReturnTrue()
member_DoNotContainValueInverse_ReturnFalse()

Branch coverage is obtained by following test cases:

member_ContainsValue_ReturnTrue()
member_DoNotContainValue_ReturnFalse()
member_DoNotContainValueInverse_ReturnFalse()



We made flow charts over the different methods.
For insert we came to the conclusion that minimum amount of testcases need for
branch coverage are four tests.
