This report regards the bundled BinarySearch.java, copied from the lab assignment with identical row alignment.

1. Run the default program, with value 4: Works
2. Run the default program, with values 1,2,3,5,6,7,8: Every case fails when they shouldn't
3. Run the default program, with values outside of the array, like 0, 9, -1, and 10, expecting failure: Every case fails as intended
4. Start debugging with the off-by-one value = 5
5. Breakpoint at row 35 to confirm that the parameters are correct: Which they are
6. Breakpoint at row 18 to confirm that the loop conditions is properly defined: Which they are
7. Breakpoint at row 20 to confirm that the method doesn't enter the if condition: Which it doesn't
8. Breakpoint at row 22 to confirm that the method enters this if condition: Which it does
9. Breakpoint at row 23 to confirm that the upper bound isn't smaller than the value itself: WHICH IT IS! BUG FOUND!
10. Solve the bug by flipping the < to a >.

We tested our solution by invoking the function like so:
