## Implementation
* We were planning to use a key/value map for fingerprint/token storage, but
  since token already contains the assigned fingerprint, and all fingerprints are
  unique, we chose a Set of fingerprints instead.
* Most methods were at first designed to return a boolean depending on if they
  succeeded or not. This proved impractical and was cut before final hand-in.

## Classes
* Enrollment Station
** Contains a Set of users (in fingerprint form)
** Ensures unique tokens for each user
** 

## Opening doors
* If an alarm is active, we assume that the offender shall not escape, and
  subsequently sound the alarm.
* If the clearance was not met, we assume that no alarm is required - alarms
  would be commonplace otherwise.
* Originally, we planned to allow invalid tokens to open some non-critical
  doors. Since the target is a high-security building, we altered our spec
  accordingly.

## Questions for grader
* How would you enable testing for something that fails a precondition at
  compile time? I.e. our test 5.
