public void setRequiredNumber(int nemployee, int starttime, int endtime);

sets the number of required working employees to nemployee for all hours
	in the interval starttime to endtime.

1. Specify (the domain and) the input space for each argument to the method (including the object of that method).

requires:	0 <= nemployee <= MAX_INT
ensures:	if nemployee > 0 then
				the method sets that amount of workers required
			otherwise
				the method doesn't set anything

requires:	0 <= starttime < endtime
ensures:	if starttime is inside the boundaries
				the method sets the start time
			otherwise
				the method doesn't set anything

requires:	starttime < endtime <= size
ensures:	if endtime is inside the boundaries
				the method sets the end time
			otherwise
				the method doesn't set anything

2. Divide this input space into partitions, based on the specification.

Input space: 0 <= nemployee <= MAX_INT

Partition #1: nemployee 

3. Implement at least one test case for each partition, and possibly additional border cases.
